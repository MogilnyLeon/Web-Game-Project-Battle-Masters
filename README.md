# Web-Game-Project: Battle Masters
Web Programming 1 Project

Project Name: Pokemon BattleMasters Battle Sim
So I was inspired by the actual Pokemon game I'm making which is named Pokemon Battle Masters. 
But because of the time constraints and requirements, I decided to do the next best thing:
A crossover between Pokemon Infinite Fusions (a very popular Pokemon fangame) and DnD
The combat is turned based and a selection of 8 characters, loosely inspired by DnD classes, are available.
